# CNN-on-Grass-Images

The School of AgriLife at Texas A&M University has data set to identify the Dark Green Color Index of Grass Images. This is important
to obtain properties of grass for various experiments as well as for agriculture. This project aims to perform a regression of images to
obtain the DGCI using a Convolutional Neural Network using Max Pooling.
